<h3>Homework 1 due Monday October 13</h3>
This program involves creating a database schema, populating the database and writing 
relational algebra and SQL queries to generate reports and answer questions about a 
baseball database. If you not acquainted with the 
game of baseball, some of the terms used in this assignment may be unfamiliar. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball">Wikipedia's baseball entry</a> may be helpful.
Also, please see me (early) if you are confused.

You will populate the database with information about teams, players and games from the
 2006 season of Major League Baseball (the major North American professional baseball
league).

<h3>Part I, Create the Database Tables and Populate the Database</h3>

The first part of the assignment involves writing SQL DDL 
statements for creating the tables of the 
database and then populating those 
tables from data files. The database should contain three 
tables: <code>team, player</code>, and <code>game</code>. 
The <code>team</code> table contains
information on baseball teams, the <code>player</code> table contains
information on baseball players, and the <code>game</code> table contains
information on the results of baseball games.
<p>
Column information for each of these tables is given below.
Since the order of the fields in the data files you will use 
to populate the tables is the same as the columns described
below, it is essential that the columns in the CREATE TABLE 
statements be in this order.
<ul>
<li>the <code>team</code> table has the following columns
<ul>
<li><b>team_id:</b>   A three character unique identifier for a team
<li><b>team_name:</b> Primary name of team, usually a city or state (eg, 'Milwaukee')
<li><b>nickname:</b>  For example, 'Brewers'. Not longer than 15 characters. 
<li><b>league:</b>    Each team is in one or two leagues: either 'AL' for American League, 
                      or 'NL' for National league
<li><b>division:</b>  'East', 'West' or 'Central'
</ul>
<p>
<li>the <code>player</code> table has the following columns
<ul>
<li><b>player_id:</b> An eight character unique identifier for a player
<li><b>lname:</b>     Last name of player
<li><b>fname:</b>     First name of player
<li><b>bats:</b>      A one character indication of the player batting batting preference. Either 'R','L' or 'B' for (right, left and both).
<li><b>throws:</b>    A one character indication of the player throwing preference. Either 'R' or 'L' (right, left).  For pitchers this indicates their pitching hand.
<li><b>primary_pos:</b> A one or two character designation of a player's primary position. One of 
'P', 'C', '1B', '2B', '3B', 'SS', 'LF', 'CF', 'RF' or 'OF'  
</ul>
<p>
<li>the <code>game</code> table has the following columns:
<ul>
<li><b>game_id</b>         A twelve character unique identifier for a game
<li><b>game_date</b>       The date for the game (use SQL 'DATE' type for this column)
<li><b>away_team</b>       The team_id of the visiting team
<li><b>home_team</b>       The team_id of the home team
<li><b>away_pitcher</b>    The player_id of the starting pitcher for the visiting team
<li><b>home_pitcher</b>    The player_id of the starting pitcher for the home team
<li><b>attendance</b>      number of people attending the game
<li><b>num_innings</b>     number of innings in the game (>9 indicates "extra innings")
<li><b>away_score</b>      number of runs scored by the visiting team
<li><b>home_score</b>      number of runs scored by the home team
<li><b>away_hits</b>       number of hits by the visiting team
<li><b>home_hits</b>       number of hits by the home team
<li><b>home_errors</b>     number of errors by the home team
<li><b>away_errors</b>     number of errors by the home team
<li><b>winning_pitcher</b> player_id of the winning pitcher
<li><b>losing_pitcher</b>  player_id of the losing pitcher
<li><b>save_pitcher</b>    player_id of the pitcher earning the save (NULL if there is no save)
</ul>
<p>
<!--
<li>the <code>event</code> table has over thirty columns describing events within a baseball game.
The CREATE TABLE statement for <code>event</code> is provided to you so only those columns that 
are needed for this assignment are described. If you are curious the other attributes, you can 
find more information at the <a href="http://www.retrosheet.org/">retrosheet</a> website. This 
<a href="http://www.retrosheet.org/datause.txt">page</a> is especially useful. The data files 
used in this assignment were created from data and programs provided by retrosheet.
-->
</ul>
<h4> What you need to do for Part I</h4>
<ol> 
<li>Login to <code>weise.cs.uwm.edu</code>. MySQL will not work on the grids. <p>
<li>Copy all files from <p>
<code>/users/csfac/joebock/Public/557/HW1/src</code>
<p>
to your favorite directory. There are two kinds of files in this directory. 
The <code>*sql</code> files contain the skeleton of SQL commands to create the tables and 
load the data. The <code>*txt</code> files are
comma separated value data files relating to the 2006 Major League Baseball season. The data in
these files were derived from data assembled by <a href="http://www.retrosheet.org">retrosheet</a>. <p>
<li>Complete the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements for the <code>team, game</code> and
<code>player</code> tables started in  
<code>ddl_team.sql, ddl_game.sql</code> and <code>ddl_player.sql</code>.
<!--The complete <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement for the <code>event</code> table is
in <code>ddl_event.sql</code>. -->
Be sure you include NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY 
constraints as appropriate. The bottoms of these files contain statements to populate the tables from 
the data files. You may want to comment out these lines when you are testing your
<code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements (# is a SQL comment character). You may also want to declare
some columns as enum's. <p>
<li>Run these statements in the MySQL interpreter. First start the mysql client by running
<pre>/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u [username] -h weise -p --local_infile</pre>
Next, make your personal database the default:
<pre> mysql> use 557_[username]_db </pre>
And finally execute the SQL commands in the .sql files using the <code>source</code> statement.
For example to create and load the <code>game</code> table run
<pre> mysql> source ddl_game.sql </pre>
You should have no errors and no warnings. If you get warnings you can view them by running  
the <code>show warnings</code> command.
<p>
I do not recommend (as implied in these steps) writing all the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements before
testing them. Rather you should iterate steps 3 and 4 often.
</ol>

<h3>Part II. Write SQL statements for all of the following queries. 
Include the relational algebra expressions for queries 1, 3, 4 and 6</h3>

<ol>
<li>Team names and nicknames of all teams in the West division of the American League.<p></li>

<li>The list of team name, nickname, league and division for all teams where teams are organized 
by leagues, within each league by division and within each division alphabetcially by team name. <p></li>

<li>A list of all primary positions, and a count of the number of players in the league that play that 
position<p></li>

<li>A report that lists each team's name and the number of extra innings games played by 
that team. That is the number of games where num_innings > 9.<p></li>

<li>The number of times the Pittsburgh Pirates scored exactly zero runs in a game in 2006?<p></li>

<li>
An alphabetical list of the first and last names of all 
pitchers who won at least one game. The list should not 
contain any duplicates<p></li>

<li>The number of games won by teams in the East division of the American League 
in June.<p></li>

<li>The number of games in which the losing team had more than 15 hits?<p></li>

<li> This final question asks you to determine which pitchers on average 
draw the largest crowds when pitching for the visiting team.
Construct a list of the first and last names and average attendence 
for the ten starting pitchers who draw the largest average crowds 
when they start road games. (use "LIMIT 0,10" at the end of the statement 
to restrict the results to the top ten. See <code> help select </code> for 
more on limit. ) Do not include pitchers who started less than ten road 
games in the season.

</ol>

<h3> What to turn in </h3>
The ddl_game.sql, ddl_player.sql, ddl_team.sql, a single file with the SQL for part 2
and the relational algebra expressions for part 2. The RA expressions can be in a separate file
or hand written
